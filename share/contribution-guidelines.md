## General Criteria

-   All tutorials should be written in English.

    -   If you’re not fluent in English, but you have a great tutorial
        to share in a different language, please reach out to us. We
        might still accept the tutorial, especially for those written in
        German or Russian.

-   Only original work will be accepted.

    -   This means that any tutorials found elsewhere on the web cannot
        be submitted (again).

-   Tutorials should work on any new unmanaged servers, not just
    Hetzner-specific servers.

    -   If a user has just ordered a server, they should be able to use
        your tutorial to install/configure everything, without needing
        to do anything else.

-   Write in a clear, easy to understand way.

    -   These tutorials will be read by users with a wide range of experience. Make sure beginners can still follow what is being done. This means it is important not to skip any steps, no matter how obvious or self-explanatory they may seem.

-   Don’t use excessive jargon or techspeak. Jokes are allowed, but don’t overdo it.

## Layout

Tutorials should all have the same basic layout:

-   Title
-   Introduction
-   Steps
-   Conclusion

The title should make it clear what the goal of your tutorial is, not just what the tutorial is about.

The first paragraph or paragraphs are there for you to explain what your tutorial will be doing. Make sure users know exactly what they will endup with if they follow your tutorial, and let them know if they need any specific prerequisites.

Steps are the actual steps users will be taking to complete your tutorial. Each step should build on the previous one, until the final step that finishes the tutorial. As mentioned earlier, don’t leave out any steps, no matter how obvious they may seem.

At the end of your tutorial, once the user has completed all steps, you
can add a short conclusion. Summarize what the users have done, and
maybe suggest different courses of action they can now take.

## Code Example

```
function test() {
  console.log("This is an example for a code block");
}

test()
```

## Formatting

The tutorials in the “Hetzner Tutorials” are all written using Markdown.
This is a markup language used all over the web. A great overview can be
found here:

## Submissions

If you think you have a tutorial that meets the criteria above, and
